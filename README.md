## Overview

I'm getting into the front end development game a little late (ridiculously late to be honest), the positive is... this means everything is still new, exciting and available for me to spend some time learning!  Join me in playing around with "all things Javascript"!!

### Gatsby & React - Oh my!

The first step was getting the hell away from GoDaddy and Wordpress - and moving everything over to Gatsby.  There are a ton amazing developers and designers that have provided a wealth of resources - I'm hoping I can pick up on a portion of what they've made available during this process.
